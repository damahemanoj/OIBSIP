      <br />
      <p>
        Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj, also known as Shivaji Raje Bhosle, was a
        prominent Indian warrior king who founded the Maratha Empire in the
        17th century. He is celebrated as an influential and iconic figure in
        Indian history, admired for his military prowess, administrative
        skills, and commitment to the welfare of his people. Shivaji's
        strategic conquests and visionary leadership led to the establishment
        of a just and tolerant rule, leaving a lasting legacy that continues
        to inspire generations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, he is honored as the father of the Indian navy for his
        recognition of the strategic importance of naval power and his efforts
        in building a formidable navy to protect the Konkan coastline and
        strengthen his empire's defenses. His memory is commemorated on
        Shivaji Jayanti, his birth anniversary, with enthusiasm in Maharashtra
        and other parts of India, where he is revered as a national hero and a
        symbol of courage, self-rule, and maritime prowess. Statues,
